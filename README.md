## Overview 

In support of opening a surf and ice cream shop located in Oahu, Hawaii, this analysis was performed to determine seasonal trends in temperature for this location. Specifically the temperatures during the months of June and December were analyzed and summary statistics were provided, in order to ascertain if the business could be sustainable year round. 


## Results

* The average temperatures between June and December only vary by about 4 degrees F
* The average temperatures for both June and December are both over 70 degrees F
* The temperature is above 69F for in both June and December for over 75% of the time

## Summary

Overall, from the data available, it seems the weather in Oahu is fairly stable throughout the year. Furthermore, it is warm enough for people to enjoy both ice-cream and surfing year round. This bodes very well for the future success of the proposed business. However, it would be worthwhile to consider further analysis of weather data for these two months. One such query could look at the temperatures vs the rainfall for each day of the months of June and December, and plot these on a combined line and bar chart. Obviously, if it is warm out but there is a high amount of rain, that could negatively impact the business. In addition a query could be conducted to look at the temperatures of each month year by year instead of combined into one data set as we have done above. This might help to identify more long term climatic trends for the location.
